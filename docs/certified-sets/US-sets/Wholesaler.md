# Wholesaler  

This data set is comprised of the views that define valid wholesalers within our enterprise data warehouse. The most well known records in these views represent the independent 3rd party and company owned wholesalers that distribute Anheuser-Busch product in the United States. However, the wholesaler views define a large number of other entities including Military locations, Breweries, International Export locations and others warehouses that receive and sell our product. These views are vital to identifying and tying any data related to AB product (Sales, Distribution, Shipments, Inventory, etc) back to the wholesaler warehouse from which it was shipped, sold or reported. These will be your primary views to identify wholesalers for any reporting purposes.

  

### **[EDW.WSLR_DM](https://app.snowflake.com/east-us-2.azure/abinbev_naz/data/databases/ABI_WH/schemas/EDW/view/WSLR_DM)**
This view is known as Wholesaler Dimension because it brings many of the descriptive attributes (or dimensions) of a wholesaler from many different tables in to a single view _making this the primary view to used when creating any reports involving wholesaler_. In this view you'll find general information about a wholesaler such as name, address, and contact info and ownership details but also Sales and Logistics specific attributes. For the Sales team attributes of interest are the Region assignment, Sales employee assignments for the Commercial Director and Commercial Manager and the MCA assignment. For the Logistics team the primary Source Brewery,Â  primary delivery transportation type and Inventory Coordinator assignments would be of interest.

This is the base view of wholesaler. It contains many of the same identifying attributes found in WSLR\_DM but unlike WSLR\_DM it doesn't have the descriptive names for the Logistics driven attributes. If using this view you will need to join to EDW.BRWY to retrieve the Name associated with the Brewery code. However, unlike WSLR_DM, this view does contain key characteristics about a warehouse's draft and package capacity.
