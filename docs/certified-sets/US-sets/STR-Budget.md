# STR Budget  

This data set contains the official US STR Budget for the calendar and fiscal year that is used for all official monthly tracking and reporting purposes. The Budget is published once a year in January and is locked from that point forward with changes only made due to acquisition or divestiture of brands impacting the scope of results. The data can be joined to [any views containing STRs](https://beertech-certified-datasets.azurewebsites.net/docs/VIP_Sales.html) in order to evaluate and analyze annual or monthly performance versus Budget. The budget is managed and maintained by the CASE â€“ Sales Planning & Forecasting team.
