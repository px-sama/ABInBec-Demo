# VIP Sales  

The VIP Sales data set is comprised of a series of tables filled with data provided by extracts received via SFTP from the _VIP Supplier Reporting Services (SRS)_ sales collection system. The VIP SRS system collects daily sales invoices from all Anheuser-Busch wholesalers along with corresponding information about Outlet (accounts) in both Cleansed and Uncleansed formats. The following views have been established in the EDW schema in Snowflake to serve as the data layer for any sales reporting applications.

### **[EDW.VIP\_SLS\_STR](https://app.snowflake.com/east-us-2.azure/abinbev_naz/data/databases/ABI_WH/schemas/EDW/view/VIP_SLS_STR)**
This is a customized view of the VIP\_SLS that only contains valid STRs as defined by outlet records in the UNCLEANSED (VIP\_WSLR\_OUTLT) outlets data and should be the primary source for any Snowflake based STR reporting queries. The view is scoped to exclude Wholesaler Customers whose assigned Class of Trade is Non-Retail (06), Direct Distributor (50) or Unassigned (99). It also contains calculated columns for volume in to Units, Cases and Barrels. Additionally, the VPID value is refreshed nightly based on the contents of the VIP\_OUTLT\_XREF view so when using the STR view there is no need to reference that view to obtain the correct VIP ID. This view will correspond directly with the invoice data loaded in VIP’s iDIG reporting tool on a nightly basis and shares the same base table as the HERO Volume application. This data is updated nightly and only after the 9pm CST sales extract is loaded in to VIP\_SLS.
