# VIP Orders  

This dataset represents Orders data collected by VIP via SRS for future delivery. When a retailer places an Order, regardless of methodology, an Order record is generated in the selling wholesaler's Route Accounting System (RAS) and that order record is then transmitted to VIP via SRS. Once an order is fulfilled an invoice is generated for the sale from that Order with details on whether the order was ready and if any items ordered were out of stock. This data is currently submitted to SRS by VIP and dBEV RAS customers with more integrations planned in the near future.Â 

  

### **EDW.VIP_ORD**
This view contains all the Orders records collected by VIP SRS and transmitted to AB. The data is updated every 2 hours throughout the business day with new records submitted to SRS. Each record contains information about an item ordered by a specific customer along with details on how the orde was placed, whether the order was fulfilled, were all products in stock and the total revenue collected for the item ordered.
