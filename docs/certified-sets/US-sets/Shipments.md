# Shipments  

This data set is comprised of views that provide visibility in to shipments sent from breweries and distribution centers to wholesaler warehouses. Shipments to wholesalers primarily consist of finished product but may also include line items for packaging, freight or deposit amounts for kegs. This data set can be joined with [Product & Brand](Product-and-Brand.md) to retrieve identifying attributes about the items shipped or destination wholesaler. It can also be joined to the [VIP Sales](VIP-Sales.md) data set if a user wanted to compare shipments to STRs.

  

### **[EDW.SHPMT\_INV\_LN](https://app.snowflake.com/east-us-2.azure/abinbev_naz/data/databases/ABI_WH/schemas/EDW/view/SHPMT_INV_LN)**
This view contains the line item detail for all invoices with a relationship to a shipment sent from an AB brewery or warehouse. An invoice may be generated for finished goods purchase, returns or adjustments to a prior invoice and all invoices are generated by Warehouse Management System (WMS). This view can be joined to EDW.PDCN\_DM view using the PDCN\_GENR\_TR\_ID to retrieve the item level detail (brand, package, etc) of items that were shipped as part of a specific shipment. It can also be joined to the EDW.WSLR_DM view to retrieve details about the destination of the shipment and what wholesaler warehouse was shipped to. Fields of interest on this view include the Order Number, Shipment Number, Shipment Date, origin, destination wholesaler, item, volume, price, taxes, and discounts.
