# Brandwatch Data  
This dataset contains a view of Brandwatch data from their Consumer Research API. Brandwatch uses social listening to gather metrics on how consumers engage with and discuss our brands on various social media platforms. The data is currently being used by MarTech and Consumer Data Science teams to understand how consumers feel about our brands.
